turn up all peppy and zingy these students are tired
whats up gamers here is my game
it's kind of an endless mining sandbox
but it also keeps you on your toes trying to survive

this is where you show the game

it is displayed as ascii art

this is where you dig some blocks and explain it

so the idea is you dig down and try to mine valuable ore, like this copper
as you go deeper and deeper the ores will get more and more valuable, as well as more abundant
this contributes to your score in the top left
the world is infinite, and it should be actually infinite,
i dont think any of the IMPORTANT numbers will overflow

this is where you demonstrate fluid dynamics / obsidian formation

your objective in this game is to get as high as score as you can before you die

how can you die? well you could fall into lava or gravel could fall on you
it seems pretty easy to not die, but

if you descend too slowly the stone will cave in on your head and kill you
AND
as you get deeper the time it takes to mine blocks gets exponentially higher
to combat this you can buy upgrades to your pickaxe in the shop with exponential cost
i've tried to get a decent balance to make it a challenge
you have to perform a balancing act of constantly moving downwards,
picking up enough valuable ore and not falling into lava

and now for the big feature
dynamite
you may have noticed you can also buy dynamite in the shop

this is where you blow something up

you can use dynamite to get ahead if you're falling behind, however
you have to be careful as it will very easily drop rubble on your head
also if you stand too close it will blow you up

this is where you die on purpose, displaying the game over screen

ok to wrap up i'm just going to go on developer mode and show some world generation

this is where you go down to about 500 depth, then 1000 to show the structures

if you want to check it out and try to get 1000 blocks deep, it's on github and i'll give you the link
